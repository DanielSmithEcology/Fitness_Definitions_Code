 Description 
##############

This code will reproduce figures 1-3 in the paper "Why there are so many definitions of fitness in models”. All code is written in R and run in RStudio. Each script can be run alone, provided the correct packages are installed (indicated in each script).  

R scripts include: “Figure_1_Code.R”, “Figure_2_Code.R”, “Figure_3_Code_Panels_A_B_C.R”, and , “Figure_3_Code_Panels_D_E_F_G.R” which produce the figures indicated in the title. Scripts s will output a SVG file of panels of each figure; the figures were finished using Microsoft PowerPoint.
